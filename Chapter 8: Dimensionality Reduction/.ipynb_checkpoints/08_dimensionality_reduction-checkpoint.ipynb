    "Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training instance. Not only do all these features make training extremely slow, but they can make it harder to find a good solution. This problem is ofter referred to as the ***curse of dimensionality***."

    "Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is often possible to reduce the number of features considerably, turning an intractable problem into a tractable one. Be careful though, reducing dimensionality does cause some information loss, so even though it will speed up training, it may make your system perform sightly worse. It also makes the pipelines a bit more complex and thus harder to maintain. So, if training is too slow, you should try to train the system with the original data before considering using dimensionality reduction. In some cases, reducing the dimensionality of the training data may filter out some noise and unnecessary details and thus result in higher performance, but in general, it won't. It will just speed up training."

    "Apart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful for data visualization because it makes possible to plot a condensed view of a high-dimensional training set on a graph and often gain some important insights by visually detecting patterns, such as clusters or to communicate the conclusions to non Data Scientist Audience, in particular decision makers."
